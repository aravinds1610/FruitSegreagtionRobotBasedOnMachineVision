# FruitSegregationRobotBasedOnMachineVision

This project aims to solve problems related to defect identification and segregation of fruits using 3-DOF articulated robot configuration with the integration of machine vision system and deep learning algorithms. Machine vision system will then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information and make the decision of what to do with the product, usually by passing it on to the next part of the process, diverting it to another process, or discarding the product from the production or distribution system. Inception-V3 algorithm is used for the machine vision operation in our solution.
